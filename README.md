# OCR-Invoice-Reader
This is a OCR Invoice reader to read and recognize the relevant texts and areas we need. Here we have used Nanonets to build and train the model. 
First of all we have used 50 + images to train the model which involves marking of annotations in the sample cases. 
After that we have trained our model and designed a program in Python and have used Nanonets API and Model ID to randomnly recognise the texts.
