# OCR-Invoice-Reader
OCR Reader is used in many fields like medical, shops, etc. for conversion of data 
written in physical format into digital form. This project was part of my hackathon where I did this 
project in a team. This is built using Nanonets OCR API that allows to built OCR models. In this 
project I worked with Nanonets API, annotated sample images, trained the model and got most accurate 
predictions based on custom input invoices.

To test this project, doenload n2.py in your desktop and change "YOUR_IMAGE_PATH" on line 5 to your image path located on your computer (For example- "C:\\Downloads\\131882.jpeg").
Important point- Please input correct image file format like jpeg, jpg, png, etc.
